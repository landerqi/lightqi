# Lightqi


For clarity, I leave all my settings unchanged. So you are suggested to modify the theme as you need.

## Install

Execute the following command and modify `theme` in `_config.yml` to `lightqi`.

```
git clone https://github.com/landerqi/lightqi.git themes/lightqi
```

## Update

Execute the following command to update Lightqi.

```
cd themes/lightqi
git pull
```


## Customization
- **About**:
+ `hexo new page "about"`
+ edit this file: `source/about/index.md`
+ config this file:`themes/light/_config.yml`

    ```
    menu:
      关于: /about

    ```
- **Intro**: Go to `layout/_widget/intro.ejs` and add your information.
